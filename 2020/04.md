Here's the April/May 2020 .NET Foundation update. Every other month, we'll give you a quick overview of the .NET Open Source landscape, including top project news, events, community links and more.

## General news

Nancy is no longer being maintained!

We would like to thank all the thousands of users of Nancy, all the people who wrote blog posts, conference speakers, video producers and those that spread the word of Nancy.

We would like to thank the 150+ contributors to Nancy that made it what it became, without you the work would have been much harder and opportunities missed.

We would like to thank VQ for financially sponsoring our open source efforts.

We would like to thank the core contributors to Nancy @jchannon, @khellang, @damianh, @phillip-haydon, @prabirshrestha, @horsdal for working hard into the nights coding, testing and writing docs but most importantly the founders of Nancy itself @thecodejunkie and @grumpydev whose vision made Nancy what it was, a fun, performant and enjoyable web framework.

We understand that organisations may have services and products that still depend on Nancy in production. A couple of members of the team can offer a support, maintenance, migration services on commercial terms. Please reach out to nancyfx.help@gmail.com to discuss options.
