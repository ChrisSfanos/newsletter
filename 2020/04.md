### JetBrains .NET Day Online 2020 - Call for Speakers

One of our Technical Steering Group members is organizing the second **JetBrains .NET Day Online on May 14, 2020**. It's a free, virtual event, where community speakers cover topics they are passionate about, ranging from deep technical .NET content and speakers' experiences with specific tools and technologies to personal development.

Right now, they are looking for speakers interested in presenting with them! JetBrains is looking for .NET topics that are relevant to a broader audience, ideally with a link to JetBrains tools like ReSharper, Rider, and the profiling tools (though this is not required). 

For more information, [head over to the Call for Speakers page](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2020/02/13/jetbrains-net-day-online-2020-call-speakers/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=resharper&utm_content=dnf2020-02)!
