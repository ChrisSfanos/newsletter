## .NET Foundation Project Updates

### [NUnit.Analyzers 0.2.0](https://github.com/nunit/nunit.analyzers/releases/tag/0.2.0)

Try out our first release ever of NUnit.Analyzers! By referencing this new NuGet package whenever you reference NUnit, you will get live, NUnit-specific diagnostics and code fixes in your IDE. Here are some of the smarts it currently provides:

- Proper usage of the TestCaseAttribute
- Proper usage of ParallelScopeAttribute
- Translation of assertions written in the classic model into the constraint model
- Proper usage of some of the most-used assertions (Is.EqualTo, Is.SameAs, Has.Count, Has.Property(...), Is.Null)

The full list of diagnostics is [here](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/NUnit-Analyzers). If you have ideas or problems, please [let us know](https://github.com/nunit/nunit.analyzers/issues).

A big thank-you to Mikkel Nylander Bundgaard who has been leading this effort, and to the contributors who helped with this release: Ace Olszowka, Jason Bock, Jason Curl, Johan Larsson, Julian Verdurmen, Maxime Rouiller, Mihály Gyöngyösi, Oleksandr Liakhevych, and Steven Weerdenburg. This is an exciting step!
