Here's the April/May 2020 .NET Foundation update. Every other month, we'll give you a quick overview of the .NET Open Source landscape, including top project news, events, community links and more.

### JetBrains .NET Day Online 2020 - Call for Speakers

One of our Technical Steering Group members is organizing the second **JetBrains .NET Day Online on May 14, 2020**. It's a free, virtual event, where community speakers cover topics they are passionate about, ranging from deep technical .NET content and speakers' experiences with specific tools and technologies to personal development.

Right now, they are looking for speakers interested in presenting with them! JetBrains is looking for .NET topics that are relevant to a broader audience, ideally with a link to JetBrains tools like ReSharper, Rider, and the profiling tools (though this is not required). 

For more information, [head over to the Call for Speakers page](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2020/02/13/jetbrains-net-day-online-2020-call-speakers/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=resharper&utm_content=dnf2020-02)!

## .NET Foundation Project Updates

## New Projects

The .NET Foundation would like to welcome the following projects that joined in February and March!

|<img width="750px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1334951/76426382-3975ee00-6368-11ea-97cf-fee658b2ce35.png"> | **Kereberos&#46;NET** <br> Kerberos&#46;NET is a managed implementation of the Kerberos authentication protocol used by the majority of production enterprise platforms. Hundreds of millions of enterprise Windows clients authenticate using Kerberos every day but there are noticeable gaps in how these clients seamlessly authenticate to cloud services. This library is intended to bridge those gaps between Windows on-premises model with hybrid cloud services without taking a dependency on any platform.|
|<img width="750px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1334951/76426382-3975ee00-6368-11ea-97cf-fee658b2ce35.png"> | **Nerdbank&#46;Gitversioning** <br> This package adds precise, semver-compatible git commit information to every assembly, VSIX, NuGet and NPM package, and more. It implicitly supports all cloud build services and CI server software because it simply uses git itself and integrates naturally in MSBuild, gulp and other build scripts.|
|<img width="750px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1334951/76427201-40513080-6369-11ea-9f30-b5146fec6338.png"> | **Nuget Trends** <br> NuGet Trends holds historical data of NuGet packages download numbers.  It's a useful tool for package maintainers to see the download rate of their packages and also for people interested in packages popularity over time. The database has the complete nuget.org catalog which include target framework information. That means that there's a lot more features we can add like TFM adoption overtime, dependency graphs etc.|
|<img width="750px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1334951/76426729-aab5a100-6368-11ea-936f-ab3ac79d957c.png"> | **Fluent Validation** <br> FluentValidation is a .NET library for building strongly-typed validation rules for objects. Additionally it provides integration for automatic validation within ASP.NET-based projects.|
|<img width="750px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1334951/76426783-bc974400-6368-11ea-90bd-40e3f56daad1.png"> | **Marten** <br> Marten gives developers a multi-paradigm framework for modelling, storing and querying data on PostgreSQL. Making use of the battle hardened database engine, Marten transparently exposes the JSON(B) capabilities of PostgreSQL for managing objects and events alike, requiring no ceremony to enable friction-less development. Marten is your object (document) and event store, with bells and whistles attached, be it CRUD, Event Sourcing or anything between.|
|<img width="750px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1334951/76426382-3975ee00-6368-11ea-97cf-fee658b2ce35.png"> | **CoreWF** <br> The Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) handles the long-running work of many companies. It powers many applications in all types of businesses. As more developers look into adopting .NET Core, some are asking if WF will be officially ported. This project only ports the WF runtime and ETW tracking provider to the .NET Standard. But much more work is needed before it can substitute for the .NET Framework version.|
|<img width="750px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1334951/76426382-3975ee00-6368-11ea-97cf-fee658b2ce35.png"> | **linq2db** <br> LINQ to DB is the fastest LINQ database access library offering a simple, light, fast, and type-safe layer between your POCO objects and your database.  Architecturally it is one step above micro-ORMs like Dapper, Massive, or PetaPoco, in that you work with LINQ expressions, not with magic strings, while maintaining a thin abstraction layer between your code and the database. Your queries are checked by the C# compiler and allow for easy refactoring.  However, it's not as heavy as LINQ to SQL or Entity Framework. There is no change-tracking, so you have to manage that yourself, but on the positive side you get more control and faster access to your data.  In other words LINQ to DB is type-safe SQL.|

## Meetups

**Our .NET Foundation sponsored [.NET Meetup Pro groups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/dotnet) are continuing to grow worldwide.** Here are some quick stats:*
* 347 Groups
* 61 Countries
*	276K Members

Our .NET Meetup Pro group helps developers find your group, as well as get involved with local events like .NET Conf Local. If your meetup hasn't joined yet, you can [right here](https://aka.ms/add-dotnet-meetup).
