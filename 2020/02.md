Here's the February/March 2020 .NET Foundation update. Every month, we'll give you a quick overview of the .NET Open Source landscape, including top project news, events, community links and more.

## General news
The Board voted to tie our [code of conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct) to always be based on the latest version of the contribor covenanant. We had been at [1.3](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/code-of-conduct/), and now we're on [2.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/). Member projects are expected adopt this update promptly. Projects that directly reference our version are all set and we encourage maintainers to review the docs to understand its contents.

## Committe Updates
The board approved the [Projects charter](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects) that details what we look for in member projects looking to join, and expectations of member projects once approved. If you have feedback/changes/discussion on specific areas, please open an issue (to discuss) or PR (to propose specific changes).

The [marketing committee](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-marketing) just had their meeting update to all members and discussed how you can get involved. There are some jobs they have available and are accepting nominations to the committee. They also went over the proposed .NET Brand book with positive feedback and hope to release it to the community soon. See the [meeting notes](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-marketing/blob/master/Meetings/2020-Mar-05/README.md) for details, deck and recording.
