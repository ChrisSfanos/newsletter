Here's the February/March 2020 .NET Foundation update. Every month, we'll give you a quick overview of the .NET Open Source landscape, including top project news, events, community links and more.

## General news

The Board voted to tie our [code of conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct) to always be based on the latest version of the contribor covenanant. We had been at [1.3](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/code-of-conduct/), and now we're on [2.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/). Member projects are expected adopt this update promptly. Projects that directly reference our version are all set and we encourage maintainers to review the docs to understand its contents.

As always, these are available both on our blog and via e-mail: [Sign up to get the .NET Foundation Update via e-mail](http://eepurl.com/dhL_qb)

## Committe Updates

The board approved the [Projects charter](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects) that details what we look for in member projects looking to join, and expectations of member projects once approved. If you have feedback/changes/discussion on specific areas, please open an issue (to discuss) or PR (to propose specific changes).

The [marketing committee](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-marketing) just had their meeting update to all members and discussed how you can get involved. There are some jobs they have available and are accepting nominations to the committee. They also went over the proposed .NET Brand book with positive feedback and hope to release it to the community soon. See the [meeting notes](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-marketing/blob/master/Meetings/2020-Mar-05/README.md) for details, deck and recording. 

## Events

This is a free, one-day livestream event that features speakers from the community and .NET product teams that are working on building native mobile apps with Xamarin technology!

### JetBrains .NET Day Online 2020 - Call for Speakers

One of our Technical Steering Group members is organizing the second **JetBrains .NET Day Online on May 14, 2020**. It's a free, virtual event, where community speakers cover topics they are passionate about, ranging from deep technical .NET content and speakers' experiences with specific tools and technologies to personal development.

Right now, they are looking for speakers interested in presenting with them! JetBrains is looking for .NET topics that are relevant to a broader audience, ideally with a link to JetBrains tools like ReSharper, Rider, and the profiling tools (though this is not required). 

For more information, [head over to the Call for Speakers page](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2020/02/13/jetbrains-net-day-online-2020-call-speakers/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=resharper&utm_content=dnf2020-02)!
