## General news
The Board voted to tie our [code of conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct) to always be based on the latest version of the contribor covenanant. We had been at [1.3](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/code-of-conduct/), and now we're on [2.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/). Member projects are expected adopt this update promptly. Projects that directly reference our version are all set and we encourage maintainers to review the docs to understand its contents.
