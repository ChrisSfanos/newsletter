* A new scheduler, which alone increased performance by over 30% in some cases
* A new code generator based on Roslyn code analysis
* Rewritten cluster membership for improved recovery speed
* Co-hosting support via [.NET Generic Host](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host?view=aspnetcore-3.0)
* New networking layer with support for TLS, based on [ASP.NET Bedrock](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/4772)
* Improved reliability and extensibility
* Many other improvements and fixes

### [DotVVM is looking for Developer Advocates](https://www.dotvvm.com/blog/64/We-are-looking-for-Developer-Advocate)

Do you want to help an open-source project to grow and find more users? DotVVM is looking for Developer Advocates - a group of individuals that could help us with publishing articles and blog posts, speaking about DotVVM at conferences or community events, recording videos or doing any other activity that would contribute to sharing the DotVVM story to the broader community of .NET developers.
