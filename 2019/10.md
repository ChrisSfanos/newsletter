From the Polly community this month:

+ **Polly.Contrib.MutableBulkheadPolicy** ([github](https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.MutableBulkheadPolicy); [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly.Contrib.MutableBulkheadPolicy)): provides a version of the classic Polly [Bulkhead](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki/Bulkhead) (parallel throttle) policy, for which the permitted parallelism can be adjusted while the policy is in use.

+ **[trydotnet-polly](https://github.com/bryanjhogan/trydotnet-polly)**: Interactive samples for Polly policies, enabled via [try-dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/try-dotnet). Thanks to MVP [Bryan Hogan](https://twitter.com/bryanjhogan).

### [DotVVM is looking for Developer Advocates](https://www.dotvvm.com/blog/64/We-are-looking-for-Developer-Advocate)

Do you want to help an open-source project to grow and find more users? DotVVM is looking for Developer Advocates - a group of individuals that could help us with publishing articles and blog posts, speaking about DotVVM at conferences or community events, recording videos or doing any other activity that would contribute to sharing the DotVVM story to the broader community of .NET developers.
