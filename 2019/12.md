## .NET Foundation Project Updates

### [Chem4Word](https://www.chem4word.co.uk/)

We're currently getting the next version, 3.1, for release for beta testing.  New features in this release include:

- Improved quality of interactive structure rendering.  We've fine-tuned the interactive existing structure display to improve both the quality of rendering and the performance
- ACME structure sketcher.  Current users can choose between ChemDoodle for Web or ACME, our new sketcher.  ACME offers several enhancements such as grouped molecules, functional group handling and the accelerated performance and fidelity of the display.
- Improved chemical label editor which now handles nested molecules
- Scaling on High DPI screens for standard dialogues is much improved
- We're bundling a new library of natural products as standard, thanks to the [CEVOpen](https://github.com/petermr/CEVOpen) project.

We've also decided to follow the convention of naming the release by year, not version number.  So this next release will be **Chem4Word 2020**.

If you want to help with beta-testing then please [email us](mailto:info@chem4word.co.uk) with the subject line 'Beta testing'.
