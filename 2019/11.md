### [Steeltoe 2.4 Boosts .NET Microservices Development with a Code Generator, New Getting Started Guides, and More](https://content.pivotal.io/dotnet/steeltoe-2-4-boosts-dotnet-microservices-development)

The Steeltoe framework helps .NET developers create cloud-native applications. As its feature set grows, so does its popularity (5.8 MM downloads and counting). Much of this innovation comes from your feedback, community contributions, and all-round improvements in the .NET runtime. The latest version, Steeltoe 2.4, boosts .NET microservices development with a code generator, new getting started guides, and more.

### [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly)

[Polly version 7.2.0](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#720) has been released!  

+ New [concurrent method support on PolicyRegistry](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki/PolicyRegistry#interfaces-and-further-syntax) - targets managing a dynamic set of circuit-breakers for use cases when the set of downstream nodes may be changing dynamically, eg in distributed systems scale-out.
+ Better .NET Framework support: Re-added explicit targets in Polly nuget package for .NET Framework 4.6.1 and 4.7.2, to avoid large dependency graph when consuming Polly from .NET 4.6.x - 4.7.1.
